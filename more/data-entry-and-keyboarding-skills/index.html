    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    In order to enhance operational skills in the use
of computers, knowledge of efficient and effective
keyboarding skills and typing ergonomics has become
inevitable today. With consistent, sincere efforts and
controlled environment, we can master keyboarding
skills and acquire high speed. Keying data into the
computer quickly and accurately, thus, becomes easy.
<br>
There are various methods of typewriting. In this
unit, we will study about various types of keys, typing
ergonomics and positioning of fingers on the keyboard
according to touch method of typewriting and use of
typing software for learning keyboarding skills.

    Keyboarding Skills
</h2>
Keyboard is the most common text-based input device. <br>
Computer keyboards are similar to electronic typewriter
keyboards with additional keys. A keyboard generally
has more than 100 keys. Each key of a keyboard
corresponds to a single symbol. Some symbols require
pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or
in sequence.
<br>It allows entering alphabets, digits and symbols into the computer. Simultaneous key press
can produce actions or computer commands. The touch
method of typewriting is a method of typing without
using the sense of sight to find the keys. There is no
need to search the key while typing and one has to move
only the finger which is needed to strike a key.
<br>A touch typist knows the location on the keyboard
through muscle memory. Touch typing typically involves
placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the
middle of the keyboard (the home row). Touch typing can
be done with two hands or by using a single hand also.
<br>A touch typist starts by placing his or her fingers on
the “start position” in the middle row and knows which
finger to move and how much to move it for reaching any
required key. It is important to learn placing fingers into
the start position blindly as the hands are frequently
raised from the keyboard to operate the line feed lever
(in the past) or (more recently) the computer mouse
<br>Typing speed generally improves with practice. The
typing speed can be increased gradually and speeds of
60 WPM (words per minute) or higher can be achieved.
The rate of speed increase varies between individuals.
Many websites and software products (e.g., Rapid
Typing Tutor) are available to learn touch typing and
many of these are free. There are many such software
available which are free of cost and are customised to
learn typing efficiently and effectively.
<br>Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either
with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with
special gaming features. 
<h2>Types Of Keys</h2>
Though there are several input devices viz. mouse,
touchscreen, character or voice recognition, etc., used
for giving input to the computer, yet the use of keyboard
is the most common method adopted for input of data
into a computer. A computer keyboard contains the
following types of keys:
<li>	<strong>
    Alphanumeric keys </strong> : All of the alphabet (A-Z)
    and numbers (0-9) on the keyboard. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Punctuation Keys:</strong>: All of the keys associated with
        punctuation, such as the comma (,), period (.),
        semicolon (;), brackets ([]), and parenthesis ({ }) and
        so on. Also, all of the mathematical operators such as
        the plus sign (+), minus sign (-), and equal sign (=)</li>

    <li><strong>Alt Key:</strong>Short for Alternate, this key is like a
        second control key</li>
    <li><strong>Arrow Keys:</strong>There are four arrow keys to move
        the cursor (or insertion point) up (↑), down (↓),
        right (→), or left (←). Arrow keys can be used in
        conjunction with the </li>
    <li><strong>Shift Or Alt Keys:</strong>To move the cursor in more
        than one position at a time. </li>
    <li><strong>Backspace Key:</strong>Deletes the character just to the
        left of the cursor (or insertion point) and moves
        the cursor to that position.</li>
